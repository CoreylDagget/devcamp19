# About this Repository

If you would like to share your notes, repositories, sketches, photos, ... you are going to take during Developer Camp
with other attendees, ... (there's a link to that place coming soon, here).

You would like to learn more? Take a look at what happened

- at **#devcamp18** in the [official 2018 repository](https://github.com/developercamp/devcamp18).
- at **#devcamp17** in the [official 2017 repository](https://github.com/developercamp/devcamp17).

Btw: Did you know that there's a new event called **[DevCamp.create](https://create.developercamp.io)**? It's a barcamp covering topics like _User Experience_, _UI Design_, _Design Thinking_ and much more. And the best of all: It's taking place at the same location and at the same time. So if you are taking part at one of the two barcamps you are able to join the sessions from the other Barcamp.

## Sessions

We prepared a [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xO9jL7DpyqyxEAFB4_iEwsiiNI4z4qawnNedcEsOB1k/edit) where you can leave your session proposals and wishes. Feel free to add your ideas!

More to come, stay tuned!
